What does git twit need to work?
Hourly updates as Twitter limits me to 350 Tweets an hour

So every hour call a rufus event where gittwit will gather all of the git
data it can and then compile its messages.

Alternatively, we could just have GitTwit be the live stream feed as well using
sockets
(Look into easy WebSockets in Sinatra I know its a bitch in Rails)
