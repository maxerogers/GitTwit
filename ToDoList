Make it possible for Dad and Lisa to share calendars
Attempt1: Google Calendar
Wasn't possible as Google Calendar Sync stopped support july 2012 and closed down the service aug 2014.
There are alternatives to sync Gmail Calendar with Outlook but they are Third Party Solutions

Attempt2: iCloud Calendar
Works, iCloud calendar provides a similar service as gmail for the iphone, mac and general cloud.
Outlook on windows has a tool to sync with outlook and works just fine. It will require Lisa to
use an icloud account we give her or one of her own. We can give her permission to view and edit
but not invite any new members to the calendar.

Attempt3: Sync over LAN

She can Print just fine
Dropbox she will have to sign in with her dropbox account i believe
